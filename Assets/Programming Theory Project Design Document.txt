Programming Theory Project Design Document


1.  Inheritance  - choose your objects

Hazards -> Fire, Electrocution, Explosion, Falling-Object, Slipping, Falling 

Stop each hazard from happening 


2.  Polymorphism - choose your behaviors

Time Till Hazard Happens
Range of Danger
Interaction Radius
Requirements to Fix/Prevent


3.  Encapsulation - choose your data

Time/Radius/Range Must be positive

Requirements/Item to fix must be a valid option/type i.e. Water STOP Fire


4.  Abstraction - choose your functions

Note some of the higher-level functions that could be useful for reuse in your code.
